when do you?
1. query string <-- when using a get form (usually)
would not design urls with query in mind
2. path <-- specific resources that we are allowing
outside of forms

urls _should_ be human readable

/articles/how-to-raise-a-monolingual-child
/articles/jk-not-really-that




Router
isolated instance of route handlers (.get .post)
and middleware
... mini application

* configure templating
* listen, etc.

a router itself can be used in your app as if it were
just middleware
